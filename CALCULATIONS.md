# Calculations, Ranking, Voting, and Decision Logic

This document provides a **scientifically rigorous** description of all formulas, weighting schemes, voting rules, and ranking decisions used in the Future-Aware Hybrid Skill Extraction pipeline and dashboard.

---

## 1. Pipeline Priority Score (recommendations.py)

The **priority_score** for curriculum recommendations is a weighted linear combination of normalized signals. **Coverage is not used by default** because the system is designed to help schools design better curriculum; existing curriculum may be outdated and is used only for insights, not for prioritization.

```
priority_score = w_demand × demand_norm
               + w_trend × trend_score_norm
               + w_future × future_norm
               + (w_coverage × coverage_gap  if use_coverage else 0)
```

### Default Weights (use_coverage=False)

| Signal | Weight | Rationale |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| demand | 0.40 | Job-market demand (frequency) is primary |
| trend | 0.30 | Empirical emerging/declining from time series |
| future | 0.30 | Forecast-aligned future relevance |
| coverage | 0.0 | Not used by default; curriculum is for insights only |

### Signal Definitions

**demand_norm** (∈ [0, 1]):
```
demand_norm = demand_freq / max(demand_freq)
```
- `demand_freq`: count of job postings mentioning the skill
- Normalized so the most frequent skill has value 1.0

**trend_score_norm** (∈ [-1, 1]):
- **Emerging**: `min(1.0, |slope| / 0.5)` — positive, capped at 1
- **Declining**: `max(-1.0, -|slope| / 0.5)` — negative, capped at -1
- **Stable**: 0
- Slope from FDR-controlled time-series regression (Benjamini–Hochberg q < 0.05)

**future_norm** (∈ [0, 1] for positive weights):
```
future_norm = future_weight / max(|future_weight|)
```
- `future_weight` from `future_weight_mapping.py` (see §2)

**coverage_gap** (∈ [0, 1]):
```
coverage_gap = 1.0 - mean(coverage_percentage) / 100
```
- 1.0 = skill not covered by curriculum; 0.0 = fully covered
- **Note:** Coverage is informational only. It is not used in the default priority score because schools use the system to design better curriculum; existing curriculum may be outdated.

### Ablation

Each signal can be disabled for ablation study:
- `use_trend`, `use_future`, `use_coverage`, `use_validity`
- When disabled, that term is 0 in the formula
- The `with_coverage` variant enables coverage for comparison

---

## 2. Future Weight (future_weight_mapping.py)

The **future_weight** maps skills/knowledge to forecast domains (WEF, O*NET, McKinsey) via SBERT embeddings:

```
future_weight = similarity(item, best_domain) × trend_score
```

### Components

**similarity**:
- Cosine similarity between item embedding and domain example terms
- Best domain = argmax over all domains in `future_domains.csv`

**trend_score**:
- From domain metadata: Strong_Growth ≈ 1.0, Moderate_Growth ≈ 0.5–0.9, Decline ≈ -0.3 to -0.6
- Encodes forecast direction for that domain

**mapping_margin** (uncertainty):
```
mapping_margin = top1_similarity - top2_similarity
```
- Large margin = confident mapping; small margin = ambiguous

---

## 3. Majority Vote (Multi-Reviewer Feedback)

When multiple reviewers assess the same item, the pipeline uses **majority vote** to merge feedback.

### Algorithm (import_feedback.py, dashboard/app.py)

```python
def _majority(votes: list) -> str:
    # Strip and filter non-empty
    votes = [str(v).strip() for v in votes if v and str(v).strip()]
    if not votes:
        return ""
    # Most common value; ties broken by first occurrence
    return Counter(votes).most_common(1)[0][0]
```

### Applied To

| Field | Valid Values | Use |
|-------|--------------|-----|
| human_valid | valid, invalid | Skill/knowledge validity |
| human_bloom | Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create, N/A | Bloom correction |
| human_type | Hard, Soft, Both | Skill type correction |
| human_quality | 1–5, poor, fair, good, excellent | Competency quality |
| human_relevant | yes, no, partial | Competency relevance |

### Inter-Rater Reliability

When ≥2 reviewers assess the same items, **Cohen's Kappa** is computed:

```
κ = (P_o - P_e) / (1 - P_e)
```
- P_o = observed agreement
- P_e = expected agreement by chance

Stored in `feedback_store/inter_rater_report.json` per feedback source.

---

## 4. Dashboard Ranking (Skills)

### Model-Only Mode

Sort key: `(-priority_score, rank, -demand_freq)`
- Uses pipeline `priority_score` as-is
- No human feedback influence

### Human-Adjusted Mode

```
human_adjusted_score = priority_score + status_boost
```

**status_boost**:
- `verified`: +0.05
- `invalid`: -0.15
- `not_verified`: 0

Sort key: `(-human_adjusted_score, rank, -demand_freq)`

**Verification status** is derived from `feedback_store/skill_feedback.csv` merged with `expert_review_skills.csv` on `review_id`, using majority vote on `human_valid` per skill.

---

## 5. Dashboard Ranking (Knowledge)

### Knowledge Aggregation

Duplicate knowledge items (same normalized text across jobs) are **aggregated**:

```
normalize(text) = lower(strip(text)), collapse punctuation/spaces
```

Per normalized key:
- `occurrence_count`: total mentions across jobs
- `confidence_score`: mean of per-row confidence
- `job_count`: distinct job_ids

**Rationale**: High occurrence indicates high demand; aggregation avoids inflating rankings with duplicates.

### Model-Only Score

```
model_score = 0.45 × conf_norm + 0.25 × fw_norm + 0.30 × occ_norm
```

- `conf_norm`: confidence_score (already 0–1)
- `fw_norm`: future_weight / max(future_weight)
- `occ_norm`: occurrence_count / max(occurrence_count)

### Human-Adjusted Score

```
human_score = model_score + status_adj
```

**status_adj**:
- `verified`: +0.12
- `invalid`: -0.18
- `not_verified`: 0

---

## 6. Dashboard Ranking (Competencies)

### Base Score (from Related Skills)

```
c_score = max(priority of related_skills)
```
- Uses skill `_human_adjusted_score` or `_model_score` depending on ranking mode
- Competency inherits the highest-priority related skill

### Human-Adjusted Score

```
human_score = 0.7 × c_score + 0.3 × q_score + rel_adj + verify_adj
```

**q_score** (quality mapping):
| human_quality | q_score |
|---------------|---------|
| 1, poor | 0.2 |
| 2, fair | 0.4 |
| 3, good | 0.7 |
| 4, 5, excellent | 0.8–1.0 |

**rel_adj** (relevance):
| human_relevant | rel_adj |
|----------------|---------|
| yes | +0.20 |
| partial | +0.08 |
| no | -0.20 |

**verify_adj**:
- `verified`: +0.12
- else: 0

---

## 7. FDR-Controlled Trend Detection (skill_time_trend_analysis.py)

**Benjamini–Hochberg** procedure controls false discovery rate:

1. Compute p-value per skill (regression slope vs time)
2. Sort p-values ascending
3. Find largest k such that p_(k) ≤ (k/m) × α, with α = 0.05
4. Reject hypotheses 1..k → q-value = p × m / rank

**trend_label**:
- Emerging: slope > 0, q < 0.05
- Declining: slope < 0, q < 0.05
- Stable: else

---

## 8. Calibrated Verification (validate_parameters.py)

Logistic regression predicts `human_valid` from pipeline scores (confidence, semantic density, etc.):

- **AUC-ROC**: discrimination
- **Brier score**: calibration (MSE of predicted vs observed)
- **Calibration curve**: 10 bins, predicted prob vs observed frequency

Optimal threshold chosen to maximize Youden index or balance precision/recall; stored in `calibrated_threshold.json`.

---

## 9. Recommendation Evaluation (recommendations.py)

When expert labels `expert_priority` (yes/no/partial) exist for top-20:

**Precision@N**:
```
P@N = (yes + 0.5×partial) / N
```

**NDCG@N**:
```
DCG = Σ (rel_i / log2(i+2))
NDCG = DCG / IDCG
```
- rel: yes=1, partial=0.5, no=0
- IDCG = DCG of ideal ranking

---

## 10. Competency–Knowledge Enrichment (Dashboard)

Lexical overlap (tokens ≥4 chars) between competency (title, description, related_skills) and knowledge items:

```
overlap = |skill_tokens ∩ knowledge_tokens|
```

Top 8 knowledge items by `(overlap DESC, confidence DESC, text)` attached as `related_knowledge`.
